# Processing-IMU-for-pendulum-motion
This is a Matlab library that processes MetaMotionR IMU sensor data 
This code is for reading and processing measured linear acceleration and Quaternions from IMUs. Run the main.m file to show preprocessing and the drift-free velocities and displacements coreesponding to measured pendulum motion.
